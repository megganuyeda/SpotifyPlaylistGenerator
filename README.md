# SpotifyPlaylistGenerator

<h2> Intro </h2>

This repo contains the files necessary to generate a Spotify playlist based on the current playing artist using Spotify's API with React. After clicking the "Generate" button, it will determine the song and artist playing, find related artists, find the artists' top tracks, choose two random tracks from 10 artists, create a new public playlist in the user's Spotify account, and add those tracks to the new playlist.
